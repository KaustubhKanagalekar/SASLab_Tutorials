# Tutorials for Safe Autonomous Systems Lab (SASLAB)

In order to get familiar with ROS2, Turtlebots, and Docker containers, I had to undertake a series of tutorials.

## Week 1 Tutorials 
The first one was to get familiar with basic ROS2 frameworks, such as publisher/subscriber models, service/client models, and building packages. For the first exercise, I had to create a random 7-Dim state and output 6-Dim using a pub/sub model. In addition, I had to simulate a
turtlesim virtually by creating a "vacuum" like pattern (again using a pub/sub model)

## Week 2 Tutorials 
The second set of tutorials required the creation of the same vacuum simulation, however this had to be simulated in RViz. 

## Week 3 Tutorials 
The third set of tutorials required implementing the scripts from the first two weeks onto the Turtlebots. The vacuum script was modified to loop only once before stopping. Additionally, I also created a script involving tracing a square.
